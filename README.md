## Description 
This webpage presents a simple calendar app for use when scheduling your work day.

Features Include:
- The current date displayed in the header section of the screen. 
- The user can enter a task into a time slot and click the save button. 
- Once the user clicks the save button, the task is stored in localStorage.
- If the page is refreshed, then the task will remain in the time slot. 
- The current time is tracked on the schedule using color coded "past", "present", or "future" classes.
